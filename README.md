# YDATA-Research-Seminar-2025-Yair-Kai
Presentations (and code) for YDATA School of Data Science Bootcamp - Research Seminar 2025
* By students: [Yair Reichman](https://github.com/Yairpt), [Kaiquan Mah](https://github.com/KaiquanMah)
* Note that in seminars, the class is divided into big groups. In each big group, we have a few pairs. Each pair focuses on a different topic each seminar
